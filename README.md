# Functional Decomposition antipattern Static Analyzer


Research project developed while practicing at the ISP RAS.

Project:
- uses LLVM+CLang tools as a library;
- detects antipattern cases by ML methods classifying (SVM, Random forest);
- trained on a third-party C++ project.

Please note that current project is just for reference.
